					<p id="para">Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.</p>
					<p id="para"><b>Why to Learn Python?</b></p>
					<p id="para">Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting  id="para"language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.<br></p>
					<p id="para"><b>Hello World using Python.</b></p>
					<p id="prog">print ("Hello, Python!");</p>
					<p id="para"><b>Applications of Python : </b></p>
					<p id="para">As mentioned before, Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here :</p>
					<ul>
						<li id="para"><b>Easy-to-learn − </b>Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Easy-to-read − </b>Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Easy-to-maintain − </b>Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>A broad standard library − </b>Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Interactive Mode − </b>Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Portable − </b>Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li>

					<header id="header"><h1 id="second">Variable Types</h1> </header>
					<p id="para">Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.</p>
					<p id="para">Based on the data type of a variable, the interpreter allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory. Therefore, by assigning different data types to variables, you can store integers, decimals or characters in these variables.</p>
					<p id="para"><b>Assigning Values to Variables</b></p>
					<p id="para">Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables.<br>The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the value stored in the variable. For example −</p>
					<p id="prog">#!/usr/bin/python<br>
				counter = 100          # An integer assignment<br>
				miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point<br>
				name    = "John"       # A string<br>

				print counter<br>
				print miles<br>
				print name</p>
				<p id="para"><b>Multiple Assignment</b></p>
				<p id="para">Python allows you to assign a single value to several variables simultaneously. For example −</p>
				<p id="prog">a = b = c = 1</p>
				<p id="para"><b>Standard Data Types</b></p>
				<p id="para">The data stored in memory can be of many types. For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric characters. Python has various standard data types that are used to define the operations possible on them and the storage method for each of them.<br><br>Python has five standard data types −<br></p>

The values of a dictionary can be of any type, but the keys must be of an immutable data type such as strings, numbers, or tuples.</p>

					<p id="para"><b>Defining a Function</b></p>
					<p id="para">You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.</p>
					<ul>
						<li id="para">Function blocks begin with the keyword def followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</li>
						<li id="para">Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.</li>
						<li id="para">The first statement of a function can be an optional statement - the documentation string of the function or docstring.</li>
						<li id="para">The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.</li>
						<li id="para">The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</li>
					</ul>
					<p id="para"><b>Syntax</b></p>
					<p id="prog">def functionname( parameters ):<br>	"function_docstring"<br>	function_suite<br>	return [expression]</p>
					<p id="para"><b>Example</b></p>
					<p id="para">The following function takes a string as input parameter and prints it on standard screen.</p>
					<p id="prog">def printme( str ):<br>	"This prints a passed string into this function"<br>print str<br>	return</p>

					<header id="header"><h1 id="tweleve">Modules</h1> </header>
					<p id="para">A module allows you to logically organize your Python code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use. A module is a Python object with arbitrarily named attributes that you can bind and reference.<br>Simply, a module is a file consisting of Python code. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code.</p>
					<p id="para"><b>Example</b></p>
					<p id="para">The Python code for a module named aname normally resides in a file named aname.py. Here's an example of a simple module, support.py</p>
					<p id="prog">def print_func( par ):<br>print "Hello : ", par<br>return</p>

					<p id="para">The simplest way to produce output is using the print statement where you can pass zero or more expressions separated by commas. This function converts the expressions you pass into a string and writes the result to standard output as follows −</p>
					<p id="prog">#!/usr/bin/python<br><br>print "Python is really a great language,", "isn't it?"</p>

					<p id="para">Python has been an object-oriented language since it existed. Because of this, creating and using classes and objects are downright easy. This chapter helps you become an expert in using Python's object-oriented programming support.<br>If you do not have any previous experience with object-oriented (OO) programming, you may want to consult an introductory course on it or at least a tutorial of some sort so that you have a grasp of the basic concepts.<br>However, here is small introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to bring you at speed −</p>
					<p id="para"><b>Overview of OOP Terminology</b></p>
					<ul>
						<li id="para"><b>Class − </b>A user-defined prototype for an object that defines a set of attributes that characterize any object of the class. The attributes are data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods, accessed via dot notation.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Class variable − </b>A variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods. Class variables are not used as frequently as instance variables are.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Data member − </b>A class variable or instance variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Function overloading − </b> The assignment of more than one behavior to a particular function. The operation performed varies by the types of objects or arguments involved.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Instance variable − </b>A variable that is defined inside a method and belongs only to the current instance of a class.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Inheritance − </b>The transfer of the characteristics of a class to other classes that are derived from it.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Instance − </b>An individual object of a certain class. An object obj that belongs to a class Circle, for example, is an instance of the class Circle.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Instantiation − </b>The creation of an instance of a class.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Method −</b>A special kind of function that is defined in a class definition.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Object − </b>A unique instance of a data structure that's defined by its class. An object comprises both data members (class variables and instance variables) and methods.</li>
						<li id="para"><b>Operator overloading − </b>The assignment of more than one function to a particular operator.</li>
